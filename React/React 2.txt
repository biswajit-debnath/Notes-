------------Creating a new react app

*  npx create-react-app name                 //npx will download create-react-app if it is not available locally and also makes sure that packages are latest version
*  npm install             //to install all project related independencies



----------------------Modularizing the react components

*  import  Component from './Module_name';       //  ./ is used if the file is the same folder i.e it is relative path
*  import  React from  'react';
*  import ReactDOM from  'react-dom';

*  export default Cpmponent;              //Exporting the particular component from the module

*  import React, { Compnent } from  'react'; 
	//This import will allows us to use class like this
	class Name extends Component { }
