* Opposite colors on the color wheel can make each other appear more vibrant when placed side-by-side.
* Primary color are RGB
* When 2 primary color are mixed a complement/secondary color is created which is not complement to any of the color which are 	
	combined to create it buto pposite to that primary color on the color wheel. For example, magenta is made with red and blue, and is the 
	complement to green.
* Tertiary colors are the result of combining a primary color with one of its secondary color neighbors. For example, red (primary)
	 and yellow (secondary) make orange. This adds six more colors to a simple color wheel for a total of twelve.

  There are various methods of selecting different colors that result in a harmonious combination in design. One example that can 
	use tertiary colors is called the split-complementary color scheme. This scheme starts with a base color, then pairs it with
	the two colors that are adjacent to its complement. The three colors provide strong visual contrast in a design, but are
	more subtle than using two complementary colors.

* hsl(dgree on color wheel,saturation percentage/amout of gray 100% for the actual color,lightness percentage/amout of white 50%
	 for actual color)
* The hsl() option in CSS also makes it easy to adjust the tone of a color. Mixing white with a pure hue creates a tint of that 
	color, and adding black will make a shade. Alternatively, a tone is produced by adding gray or by both tinting and 
	shading. Recall that the 's' and 'l' of hsl() stand for saturation and lightness, respectively. The saturation percent 
	changes the amount of gray and the lightness percent determines how much white or black is in the color. This is useful 
	when you have a base hue you like, but need different variations of it.

* Darker color variations are made by lowering brightness and increasing saturation. Brighter color variations are made by 
	increasing brightness and lowering saturation.-
