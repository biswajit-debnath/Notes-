1.   Svg animation camn only be done if it is embed in html
2.   Svg can be animated using js
     Some frameworks are
	snap.svg
	velocity.js
	GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)
3.  <g></g> It is container for grouping svg elements like path circle
4.  transform-origin:50% 50% doesn't works in firefox so pixel ualue is used 
	pixel value can be obtained from cx(centered x) and cy from svg file



5.  @keyframes name {     //Defines the animation what to do at 0% time 30%time ect
	0%{ }
	30%{}
	....
    } 
   //Css rule to apply this animation
	animation: keyframe_name  duration  delay  timining_fn  animation_fill_mode=backwards//scaling begans at 0%;
	animation-delay: 
	

6.   stroke-dasharray: 5;  //Create a dashed stroke with 5px length stroke and 5px blank space
7.   stroke-daskoffset: 5; //Moves all dashes and blank spaces by 5px

*https://codepen.io/himmel/full/xbNJaZ/*//To understand dasharray/offest

8.    //To animate the stroke
	a. Determine the length of the total stroke
	b. Make the stroke dasharray to total length of stroke
	c. Offset completely so that the entire stroke goes out of vision range and vision range is covered by space of dasharray
	d. Animate the offset to 0 so that sapce moves out of vision slowely and stokes comes in vision range
	
	/****************************************/
	To get the length of entire stroke in px from js
	var path = document.querySelector('.path');
	var length = path.getTotalLength();
 


9.   <defs></def>  //groups element so it can be repeated using use tag
   *To use contect in def tag
	<use xlink:href="#id_of_g_tag"  fill="color"  transform="scale(1.4)"/>
	


10.    <symbol id="Id_name" viewBox=""></symbol>
	<svg width="150" height="150">
	<use xlink:href="#id_of_g_tag fill="color" class="clsName">
	</svg>                                        //In symbol tag we can use width and height of particular svg relative to its viewBox
  **We have to add style="display:none" in main svg file to hide the svg container **

11.   currentColor property stores the color value of the element or its parent
